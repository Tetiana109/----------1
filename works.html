        <p>Designing effective dashboards involves prioritizing user needs and clear objectives, organizing information logically, and using simple, consistent, and visually clear design elements. The most important data should be placed prominently and be immediately accessible, adhering to the "five-second rule," and visualizations should be chosen specifically to represent the data clearly without clutter.</p>
