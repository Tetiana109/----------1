        <h3>Designing Dashboards</h3>
        <p class="year">2020</p>
        <p>Designing effective dashboards involves prioritizing user needs and clear objectives, organizing information logically, and using simple, consistent, and visually clear design elements. The most important data should be placed prominently and be immediately accessible, adhering to the "five-second rule," and visualizations should be chosen specifically to represent the data clearly without clutter.</p>

        <h3>36 Days of Malayalam type</h3>
        <p class="year">2018</p>
        <p>"36 Days of Malayalam type" is not a standard project, but it likely refers to artists interpreting the Malayalam alphabet within the global "36 Days of Type" challenge, where participants create designs for each letter and number over 36 days. You can find many examples of these interpretations by searching for "#36daysoftype" and variations that include "Malayalam," or by exploring Behance and Instagram for posts specifically from Indian artists who have participated.</p>
